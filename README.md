## About

I am an Automation Architect and SDET with a strong balance of strategic ownership and hands-on engineering. I design automation frameworks, define QA strategy, and work closely with teams to build reliable, maintainable test solutions across complex systems.

I enjoy solving quality problems at architecture level while staying close to the code.
